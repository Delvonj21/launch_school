# Create a Car class that meets these requirements:

# Each Car object should have a model, model year, and color provided at instantiation time.

# You should have an instance variable that keeps track of the current speed. Initialize it to 0 when you instantiate a new car.

# Create instance methods that let you turn the engine on, accelerate, brake, and turn the engine off. Each method should display an appropriate message.

# Create a method that prints a message about the car's current speed.

# Write some code to test the methods.
