# You've been given a list of vocabulary words grouped into sub-lists, by meaning. This is a two-dimensional list or a nested list. Write some code that iterates through and prints all the words, one per line.

vocabulary = [
    ["happy", "cheerful", "merry", "glad"],
    ["tired", "sleepy", "fatigued", "drained"],
    ["excited", "eager", "enthused", "animated"],
]

for nested_lst in vocabulary:
    for element in nested_lst:
        print(element)
